The goal of this package is for easily applying same t-tests/basic data description across several sub-groups, with the output as a nice arranged `data.frame` instead of the detailed listed information. Multiple comparison and the significance symbols are also provided.

This kind of analysis is commonly seen in ROI (Region-of-interest) analysis of brain imaging data. That's why the package is called `roistats`.
